# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop outcomes of fundraisers based on their launch dates and funding goals. To achieve this, I used advanced formulas and terminologies, interactive charts and graphs with pivot tables and  to organize the data with filters and conditional formatting. The above mentioned skills allowed me to reveal trends which would help Louise.
## Analysis and Challenges
This project constitutes two main analysis.  The first is the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date and second, The Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals. Both analysis involved 
organizing, filtering, sorting and visualizing the data. Below gives a detailed description of both analysis.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
With this challenge, I needed to ensure that I organize, sort, filter and visualize the data set to allow me read the trend based on outcomes on launch date. I did that by creating an additional column  called “Years” to the Kickstarter worksheet. The data for this column was derived from the use of the Year() function from the “ Date Created Conversion” column. This step would allow me to easily create a pivot table and chart.
